	STICKMAN: An endless 2D platformer with resource management.

  ///////////////
 /// Concepts //
///////////////

	Characters:
	* Segmented health bar [Convey easily digestible information]
	* Damage taken results in knockback damage
	* If target wasn't killed then target will also damage you

	Player:
	* Move up, down, left and right [Move world relative to player]
	* Switch weapons with scroll and or number keys
	* Use items/weapons with spacebar

	Enemies:
	* Patrol until line of sight or.. heard the player performing an action?
	* Multiple types.. dependent on weapons, stats and or behavior?
		* Health variety forces strategy

	Items:
	* Medkits
	* Potions that boost specific weapon stats temporarily?

	Weapons:
	* Alternative weapons have improved stats over the fists but have limited uses (durability) and some require an item to use

	Level:
	* Something that forces the player to constantly progress like a BR circle or the demon monkeys in Temple Run.

  /////////////////
 /// Priorities //
/////////////////

	1.) Enemies: This is the most important aspect of the game. If the enemies aren't fun to play against then why play?
	2.) Weapons: This is the main way of how the player will interact with enemies and the level.
	3.) Levels: Procedural environments could break repetition.
	4.) Player: Interesting movement mechanics are a necessity in platformers.
		* Dive to the ground.
		* Mantle on surfaces.
	5.) Graphics: It shocks me how decent the current animations are.
